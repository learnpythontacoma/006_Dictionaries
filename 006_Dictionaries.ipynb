    "\n",
    "A *key-value* pair is a means to store data where a key is given to a value in order to recall that value. Every key is connected to a value in a dictionary, and these are separated by a colon, with every individual key-value pair being separated in a dictionary by a comma. \n",

    "1. You can store as many *key-value* pairs as you would like in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dictionary, the *key-value* pairs may be in any order. As long as the same *key-value* pairs are in a dictionary when comparing two dictionaries, Python will still see these dissimilarly ordered dictionaries as being equal. That's different from lists or tuples where items are ordered and the order matters.\n",
